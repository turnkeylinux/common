  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):

    - Refactor start up (now hooks into getty process, rather than having it's
      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Refactor firstboot.d/01ipconfig (and 09hostname) to ensure that hostname
      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.
    - Package turnkey-make-ssl-cert script (from common overlay - now packaged
      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.

    - Show blacklisted password characters more nicely.
    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.
    - Support returning output from MySQL - i.e. support 'SELECT'. (Only
      applies to apps that include MySQL/MariaDB).

  * Web shell (shellinabox):

    - Completely removed in v18.0 (Webmin now has a proper interactive shell).

      above webmin note &/or #1904.

  * Backup (tklbam):

    - Ported dependencies to Debian Bookworm; otherwise unchanged.

  * Security hardening & improvements:

    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.

      backports. Also support non-free backports.

    - Adminer (only on LAMP based apps) listen on IPv6.
    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:

    - Remove rsyslog package (systemd journal now all that's needed).
    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
    - Improve turnkey-artisan so that it works reliably in cron jobs (only
      Laravel based LAMP apps).
